## Stage 1: Extract Transform and Load 

### Steps followed 

**Step 1: Launch the Power BI app and Load data**

1. Launch the Power BI Desktop in your local Machine

2. The File containing the dataset for this project are contained in 2 Folders labelled 
* Inpatient and 
* Outpatient 
with each folder containing 4 excel files representing each year.

3. check all the 4 excel files and accertain they have the same headers. This is to enable joining(combine) the 4 files effectively

4. Load the Inpatient Folder into Power BI using the Folder data connector.

6. on checking thier datatypes notiice the Archive_Date is not in the Date datatype. Perform the following to correect the anomaly

        1. Go to the Table View and highlight the Archive_Date column
        2. Go to the Datatype field and select Date

7. Inspect all the columns to ensure the datatypes fits the columns


8. Select the Transform Data option to enter the Power Query Editor.
Observe that we have imorted the following Tables into the Power Query

        * Inpatient
        * Outpatient


![Presentation1](https://github.com/nnannaeze/Sales-Team-Quarterly-Report/assets/148848746/dcba22f7-d780-47f8-b273-867cfaefa88d)     

**Step 2: Perform data Transformation on the Queries**

![image](https://github.com/nnannaeze/Sales-Team-Quarterly-Report/assets/148848746/ba1aa321-baf4-424a-bb10-b231b785fe62)

1. Optimize the dataset by assigning datatypes accordingly. Ensure that every column in all the Queries are in their correct datatype.


2. Join the two Datasets into 1 using the Append method by following these Steps
       
        1. Check if the 2 Tables Have the same Headings. Notice that Inpatient table has a 
        column = specialty_Name 
        while Outpatient table has 
        column = Specialty
        change the name for Outpatient to specialty_Name.

        2. Theres a column in the Inpatient dataset(case_type) that is not in Outpatient dataset. 
        A closer look on the case_type column shows it only contains "Inpatient" & "Day case" 
        which shows the status of the inpatients while it was not created in Outpatient query
        because all outpatients have same status which is "Outpatient".
        Because we are joining the 2 Queries, we need create the case_type column in the Outpatient query 
        and populate it with "Outpatient". The following shows how to create the new column in the Outpatient query.

        1. Navigate to Add column tab and select Custom Column
        2. New column name: case_type
           Custom column formula: "Outpatient"
           press ok to create the new column.

        3. Drag the column to the exact same position like in the Inpatient query after the specialty_Name.

        4. On the Home Tab, Go to Append Queries dropdown and select Append Queries as New.
        * First Table: Inpatient
        * Second Table: Outpatient
        * Rename the new Query from Append_1 to All_Data

3. Check the columns by clicking on the headers to inspect how the values are represented whether there re some repetitions. In the `Time_Bands` column, there are irregularities in there values as numbers like **18 Months +**, **18 + Months** which represents the same thing and  **0-3 months**, **3-6 Months**, **6-9months** etc appearing twice instead of once. 
![image](https://github.com/nnannaeze/Sales-Team-Quarterly-Report/assets/148848746/7427f8a7-8509-4196-b967-3c31c8c153f4)

we perform the following Transformation on the column

        1. Replace 18+ Months with 18 Months +
                * Go to Transform Tab and select Replace values
                * Values to find: 18+ Months
                  Replace with: 18 Months + 
        2. Use Trim to tidy every other anomalies in the column like double spav=cing etc 
                * On the Transform Tab, select Format from the Text Column group
                * select Trim from the Format dropdown

4. Close and Apply to return to Power BI Desktop.


#### **Step 3: Data Modelling**
1. Import another csv Dataset `Mapping_Specialty` into Power BI Desktop Using csv Data connector and select Transform to open in Power Query.

2. Notice that the 1st row is actually the Headers. change the first row to Headers

        * select the first box dropdown in the Table that has a Table icon and select Use First Rows as Headers

3. Close and Apply

4. Go to the Model view of the Power BI Desktop


5. There are 4 Tables in the Model view, Hide Inpatient and Outpatient from the Reprt view to avoid confusion 

        select the ellipsis and select hide in report view

6. Establish a relationship between the `All_Data` and the `Mapping_Specialty` Tables. Notice Power BI already established a relationship between specialty_Name and Specialty respectively.

7. Delete any other relationship other than the established one between `All_Data` & `Mapping_Specialty`

## Stage 2 Analysis:
 **Step 1: Create Tables and Measures**

 1. Create a table `Calculation Method` that will contain *Average* and *Median* mode which are the bases for the Calculations

        Navigate to home tab and select Enter data,
        a new Table appears, we rename it Calculation Method
        Rename the column: Calc Method
        1st row: Average
        2nd row: Median
        Load

        

 2. Create a table where all the measures will be stored.

         Navigate to home tab and select Enter data,
         a new Table appears, we rename it Key_Measures
         Load




        Note*: The + 0 is to make the expression not to return blank when subjected to certain situations using Slicers.


3. Create the Median Wait List Key_Measure
        
        Median Wait List = MEDIAN(All_data[Total])

4. Create the Average Wait List Key_Measure

        Average Wait List = AVERAGE(All_data[Total])


5. Create a Measure that will switch between *Average Wait List* and *Median Wait List* depending on the selected Row in the Calc Method of the `Calculation Method` Table.

        Avg/Med Wait List = SWITCH(VALUES('Calculation Method'[Calc Method]), "Average", [Average Wait List], "Median", [Median Wait List])

6. Create the Latest Month Wait List Measure

        Latest month Wait List = CALCULATE(SUM(All_data[Total]), All_data[Archive_Date] = MAX(All_data[Archive_Date])) + 0

7. Create the Previous Year Latest Month Wait List Measure

        PY Latest Month Wait List = CALCULATE(SUM(All_data[Total]),
        All_data[Archive_Date] = EDATE(MAX(All_data[Archive_Date]),-12)) + 0

        
8. Create a Background display Measure that will display a message(No Data to Display for the selected Specialization) instead of displaying **blank**

        Background disp = IF(ISBLANK(CALCULATE(SUM(All_data[Total]),All_data[Case_Type] <> "Outpatient")), 
        "No Data to Display for the selected Specialization", "")

9. Create another Background display Measure that will display a message(No Data to Display for the selected Specialization) instead of displaying **blank**

        Background disp2 = IF(ISBLANK(CALCULATE(SUM(All_data[Total]),All_data[Case_Type] = "Outpatient")), "No Data for the selected category", "")

10. create the Total Sales Measure

        right click on Key Measure and select New measure
        write the following DAX expression

                Latest month Wait List = CALCULATE(SUM(All_Data[Total]),
                 All_Data[Archive_Date] = MAX(All_Data[Archive_Date])) + 0


11. Create a dynamic Title that will change inline with the selected Row  in the Calc Method of the `Calculation Method` Table.

        Dynamic Title = SWITCH(VALUES('Calculation Method'[Calc Method]), "Average", "Key Indicators- Patient Wait List: Average", 
        "Median", "Key Indicators- Patient Wait List: Median")
